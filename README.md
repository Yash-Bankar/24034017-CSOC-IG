## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements and compares two neural network models for predicting patient no-shows in medical appointments using the **Medical Appointment No-show** dataset:

- ✅ A **Vanilla Neural Network** built from scratch using NumPy  
- 🔥 A **PyTorch-based Neural Network**

Both models were trained and evaluated using Accuracy, F1 Score, PR-AUC, and Confusion Matrix.
