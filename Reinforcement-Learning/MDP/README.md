## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This project implements and compares Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms on different variants of the Frozen Lake environment using the `gymnasium` library. The key goals include:

- Applying Value Iteration on:
  - Original FrozenLake-v1 environment
  - Custom deterministic environment
  - Expanded complex environment
- Evaluating performance across all environments using quantitative metrics
- Documenting findings in a LaTeX report
